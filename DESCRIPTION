Description: Fietstelweek is, translated from Dutch, the National Bicycle Count week. 
    It is a crowdsourced initiative to collect data about daily bike trips which 
    will serve to improve the cycling infrastructure of the national, regional, and 
    local bike network. The data was collected during a week, between September 14th and 
    20th, for 2015, and between September 19th and 25th for 2016. 
    This package allows to download, summarize, plot, and explore the data in R 
    for a study area within the Netherlands. This allows for a faster data visualization 
    and analysis of the data by clipping it to a maneageble size for R.
